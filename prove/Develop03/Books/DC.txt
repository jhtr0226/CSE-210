D&C|61:36|And now, verily I say unto you, and what I say unto one I say unto all, be of good cheer, little children; for I am in yourcmidst, and I have not forsaken you;
D&C|121:7-9|My son, peace be unto thy soul; thine adversity and thine afflictions shall be but a small moment;||And then, if thou endure it well, God shall exalt thee on high; thou shalt triumph over all thy foes.||Thy friends do stand by thee, and they shall hail thee again with warm hearts and friendly hands.
