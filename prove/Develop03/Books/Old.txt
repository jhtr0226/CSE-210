Jeremiah|1:5|Before I formed thee in the belly I knew thee; and before thou camest forth out of the womb I sanctified thee, and I ordained thee a prophet unto the nations.
Isaiah|55:8-9|For my thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways my ways, saith the Lord.||For as the heavens are higher than the earth, so are my ways higher than your ways, and my thoughts than your thoughts.
